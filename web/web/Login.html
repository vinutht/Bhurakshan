This is just a place holder and it is a workaround for showing jquery based login prompt instead of BASIC browser login prompts.
I am using FORM based authenticator and the form based authenticator points to this file when user tries to access a private resource for the first time.

I will just ignore this file and I will just prompt jquery login dialogue.
Ya I know you did not get any thing out of this comment but its quite difficult to explain.
